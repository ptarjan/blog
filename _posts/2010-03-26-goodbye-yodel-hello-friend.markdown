Today is my last day at Yahoo! 

I made a video to commemorate the occasion and reminisce over my last [1032][1] days being a Yahoo. 

Co-starting [SearchMonkey][2] and being the [Chief Technical Monkey][3] was a dream come true, and I couldn't have asked for a better [manager][4] and team. Traveling with [HackU][5] was icing on my already delicious [(cup)cake][6]. 

Cheers to all my Yahoo! friends and I look forward to my new adventure at Facebook.
