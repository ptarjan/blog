So Michelle messaged me at 6:00 that there was a Weird Al concert tonight! I quickly finished up my work (posting the death message for <a href='http://builder.search.yahoo.com'>Search Builder</a>) as she drove up to my work. 

<p>
It turned out it was at the <a href='http://www.sanmateocountyfair.com/'>San Mateo County Fair</a>. Yeah, a fair. Like with a booth where you can pay $1 to see a 1000 lbs. pig, a vegetable competition, and all the poorly maintained fair rides you can imagine. 

<p>
The concert turned out to be in a huge shed, and it was packed! We got really crappy seats way in the back on the floor, but with me singing all the songs really loudly, it didn't matter :) I knew everyone except for "I'm in love with the Skipper". The ending "Albuquerque" was an awesome rendition :) "Do you have any lingonberry donuts?", "NO! We're out of lingonberry donuts!", Do you have any Halle Berry donuts?", "NO! We're out of Halle Berry donuts!".

<p>
But the best part of all, was that I got a very 'fitting' shirt for me:
