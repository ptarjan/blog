So, I think I've been playing GTA IV too much.

I was driving home yesterday, and I looked in my rear view mirror and saw a nice shinny car with a rounded hood and a silver finish. I quickly thought "Maybe I should swing my car sideways, get out and take that car instead. Then I can call Brucie for a race." Then that little voice in my head said "Paul, you're driving your Prius, which is pretty freaking nice, and the is no number for Brucie in your phone... oh, and by the way, THIS IS REAL LIFE". 

All of that happened in about a quarter of a second, but still kinda creepy that I thought that at first. Oh well, back to GTA IV.
