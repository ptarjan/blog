So, I've had the flu for the past few days, and Michelle had to go out to see her Dad run an Ironman. There would be no one to make me chicken noodle soup! No one to get me Giner Ale! 

<p>
So what does she do to compensate:

She lays out everything that will make me feel good and even a tea cup with suger already in it :) Thanks Michelle! You're the best!
