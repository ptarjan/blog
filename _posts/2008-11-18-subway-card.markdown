As some might have noticed, Subway just came out with a new Point system. Doing some quick back-of-the-napkin math:
<table><tbody><tr><th>Number of Points</th><th>Item</th><th>Face Value</th><th>$  /point</th></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>1 Cookie</td><td>$0.49</td><td>$0.049</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>1 Bag of Chips</td><td>$0.99</td><td>$0.066</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>21 oz. Drink</td><td>$1.39</td><td>$0.0695</td></tr><tr><td>35</td><td>Mini Sub</td><td>$2.69</td><td>$0.07686</td></tr><tr><td>50</td><td>Regular 6" Sub or Wrap</td><td>$3.69</td><td>$0.0738</td></tr><tr><td>75</td><td>Regular Footlong Sub or Salad</td><td>$5.89</td><td>$0.0785</td></tr></tbody></table>

I had to approximate some prices, but I just arbitrarily picked a Ham Sub since it was on all 3 of the lists (mini, 6", 12").

So, even taking a cheep Ham sub, it is better to save up for the footlong. Especially if you want to go all the way and get a fancy footlong!

Their old "Buy 12 get 1 free", would have converted to 60 points for a Footlong, and 36 points for a 6" (assuming 5 points / footlong, and 3 points / 6"). So the Footlongs got a bit more expensive, but still almost comparable to the old system.
