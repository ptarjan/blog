I found some excellent sentences worth reposting:

<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_while_John_had_had_had_had_had_had_had_had_had_had_had_a_better_effect_on_the_teacher'>James while John had had had had had had had had had had had a better effect on the teacher</a>

Which when we add some punctuation :

James, while John had had "had," had had "had had"; "had had" had had a better effect on the teacher.

Which makes perfect sense if you read it out loud :)

Also:

<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_buffalo_Buffalo_buffalo_buffalo_buffalo_Buffalo_buffalo'>Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo</a>

which talks about the bison whom live in the city Buffalo pushing around other bison.

and "Fish fish fish fish fish" = Fish(n) (whom) fish(n) fish(v), fish(v) fish(n) = Fish which are fished by fish, fish other fish.

Isn't language fun?
