I needed a list of as many <a href="http://worldofwarcraft.com">World of Warcraft</a> players as I could find. Sadly, blizzard wasn't giving this out on <a href="http://wowarmory.com">wowarmory</a> and neither were any other sites I could find. Thankfully, I'm good at web scraping.  

So, I went through each region, server, guild, and character on <a href="http://wowjutsu.com/">wowjustsu</a> and pulled out 1.75 Million characters.   

* 1,019,737 US wowarmory links <a href="http://www.box.net/ptarjan#1:31231570:324466458">(gz)</a> <a href="http://www.box.net/ptarjan#1:31231570:324468030">(zip)</a>
* 741,321 EU wowarmory links <a href="http://www.box.net/ptarjan#1:31231570:324465646">(gz)</a> <a href="http://www.box.net/ptarjan#1:31231570:324467770">(zip)</a>

World of warcraft claims over 10 Million players, wowjutsu claims 4 Million users but I could only find 1.75 Million. Maybe the rest are unguilded or their guilds aren't listed. Either way, 1.75 Million is good enough for me, hopefully it helps you out.
