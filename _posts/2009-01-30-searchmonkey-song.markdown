I wrote a little song for my product at work, [SearchMonkey](http://developer.yahoo.com/searchmonkey) \(or Search Monkey if you want to misspell it\).

Enjoy :) And please suggest more verses or make a video with it :)

Lyrics: 

    SearchMonkey get information
    SearchMonkey help you out
    SearchMonkey store structured data
    That you can't live without.
     
    You say old searching very diligent
    But its output stink
    Result not functional or elegant
    What do SearchMonkey think?
     
    SearchMonkey think maybe developer want to write god damn result page himself
    SearchMonkey just say it out loud
    SearchMonkey is crazy and proud
     
    SearchMonkey like Yahoo!
    SearchMonkey like semantic knowledge
    SearchMonkey very simple app
    That anyone can use:
    Even Monkey like you

Note: This is NOT endorsed by Yahoo! or anything like that. It is just me having a little fun :)
