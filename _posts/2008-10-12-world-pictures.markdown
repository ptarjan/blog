So <a href='http://lerdorf.com'>Rasmus</a> has been spending countless hours cleaning up the flight data so we can do some neat hacks. My first hack was to visualize all of the commercial airports on <a href='http://maps.google.com/maps?q=http%3A%2F%2Ftravel.slowgeek.com%2Fv1%2Fairports%3Fformat%3Drss'>Google Maps</a>, in <a href='http://paul.slowgeek.com/flights/airports.php'>Yahoo Maps</a> (only use a good JS browser like Safari), in <a href='http://travel.slowgeek.com/v1/airports/sfo?format=rss'>GeoRSS</a> or in <a href='http://travel.slowgeek.com/v1/airports/?format=kml'>KML</a> (Google Earth).

The next hack will be all the planes visualized over time. I have the data working but it is too much for any visualizer so far, and keep crashing them (or grinding them to a halt). Who would think that 61 million flights is too much?

After working with the flight data as a hack, I guess I'm in the "visualizing the earth mood". Here are some awesome pictures.
