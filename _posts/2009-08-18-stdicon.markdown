From the idea of <a href="http://twitter.com/progrium/status/3373976979">progrium</a> I did a fun little hack last night.  

(mimetype or file extension) -> icon == <a href="http://stdicon.com">stdicon.com</a>  

In the vein of gravatar's simple URLs, just add the file extension, or mimetype onto the path, and you will get a good icon representing it. <img src="http://stdicon.com/html?size=16"> There are more options for choosing your icon set, size, and default, but head over to the <a href="http://stdicon.com">root page</a> to find out more.  

It's <a href="http://github.com/ptarjan/stdicon/tree/master">open source</a>, so fork and fix. And if you have any ideas for good icon sets, please post a comment or email me and I'll get them into the system.
