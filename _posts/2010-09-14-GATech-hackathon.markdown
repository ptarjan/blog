We just finished our first ever [Camp Hackathon](http://www.facebook.com/camphackathon) at Georgia Tech. I think this is the most people I've ever seen stay up for the whole 24 hours. Our very own [Justin Mitchell](http://www.facebook.com/justin) pulled the all-nighter, and then continued on until 3am the next morning! I haven't heard from him, I hope he's still alive... 

Here is the answer to "who stayed up all night?"

![People who stayed up all 24 hours](http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc4/hs425.snc4/46863_127506340632086_114869201895800_140854_1225298_n.jpg)
## Viral Award - Scategories

As a fun twist, we said whoever could get the most likes on their post, would win a prize. After only about 50 minutes, the winners had a whopping 37 likes! What a friend-graph they have.

They built a scategories Java app based on the course descriptions for their 8 specializations.

## [Best Birthday Wishing Service](http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=140873&id=114869201895800) - [Lazy Wisher](http://www.bdesouza.com/facebook/)

Taking slacking to whole new heights! This app will automatically ease the pain of having over 500+ 'friends'. Just add this app and let the automatic b'day wishes flow from your 'heart' and into your 'friends' wall. Be the 'friend' everyone thinks you are and install this app.

## [Second Place](http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=140874&id=114869201895800) - [Social Juke Box](http://azharb.com/sjb/)

Social Juke Box is an application that lets you browse through music suggested by your friends to you. In the author's opinion, this is what Apple Ping should have been.
